# G-Coder Python module

This is a python module that writes g-code.  It is intended to be
called from a program that has an idea of some cuts it wants to make.
G-coder functions write g-code to an output file.  Some G-coder
functions correspond directly to specific G-codes, and some to more
complex operations consisting of longer sequences of g-codes.

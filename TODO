What I want for the first step is a simple CAM program that reads an
SVG and makes a pocketing toolpath from the interior of the path.

It must be scriptable.

A future version might have an optional GUI.  This GUI should display
the input SVG and the computed tool path, and let you export the toolpath
as g-code.

I'm planning to use svgpathtools to compute the offset paths needed,
so it would be most convenient if i could render its Path objects.


# Future embellishments

* Leave behind some finishing allowance.

* Cut along the path (outside, inside, or right on top, optionally with
  work-holding tabs.

* Pockets with islands.

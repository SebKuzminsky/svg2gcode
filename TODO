What I want for the first step is a simple CAM program that reads an
SVG and makes a pocketing toolpath from the interior of the path.

It must be scriptable.

A future version might have an optional GUI.  This GUI should display
the input SVG and the computed tool path, and let you export the toolpath
as g-code.

I'm planning to use svgpathtools to compute the offset paths needed,
so it would be most convenient if i could render its Path objects.


# Future embellishments


* offset_path() should be named offset_paths(), since it returns a list
    of paths.

* Specify cut parameters (max doc, max woc, speed, feed) for plunging,
    slotting and shoulder milling, for roughing and finishing.

* Override pocket cut params from command line.  Width of cut is a
    function of depth of cut.

* Specify preamble (set G64P, G40, etc, like gcoder.init()).

* Join adjacent offset curves smarter.  First cut a slot offset by
    finishing allowance + tool radius, then shoulder mill to the inside
    by the shoulder milling doc.  Or first slot the innermost path,
    then shoulder mill out?  Watch how the depth of cut compares between
    slotting and shoulder milling.

* Cut along the path (outside, inside, or right on top, optionally with
  work-holding tabs.

* Pockets with islands.

* Get rid of the feed() function, switch everything to set_feed_rate(),
  which is unlikely to collide with users' variables.


== Look into replacing svgpathtools with something else

=== Possible options

==== pythonocc/liboce

pythonocc isn't packaged, liboce doesn't have python bindings in stretch


=== occmodel

A python front-end to the OpenCASCADE modelling kernel.  Jeff used it
for CAD in python.

Not packaged in Stretch (though liboce is).


=== libpolyclipping

aka clipper

https://sourceforge.net/projects/polyclipping/

http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php

In Debian as libpolyclipping: https://packages.debian.org/stretch/libpolyclipping16

No arcs, we'd have to approximate using linear splines.

FreeCAD 0.17's Path workbench uses clipper.


=== libarea

https://github.com/Heeks/libarea.git


=== opencamlib

Anders Wallin's project.  Not in debian.


=== Considered and discarded

==== svg.path + shapely

Shapely doesn't do arcs or bezier curves, only linear splines.
Which is maybe fine.  Shapely has parallel_offset(), left and right...
FlatCAM uses Shapely.


=== libclippoly http://clippoly.sourceforge.net/

Lines only, no arcs, no bezier curves.

Doesn't do offsetting.


=== gpc

Not libre.


== Fix units handling

When the SVG uses mm everything's fine, but the mini-liner svg in the
griptilian scales project uses inch(?) units and the result is the
wrong size.


== Smart transitions

I want better transitions from a finished pass to the start of the
next pass.

It currently does "raise, traverse, plunge", which is simple, safe,
slow, and plungy.

Sometimes one pass ends very near the start of the next pass.  In this
case it'd be better to feed there directly, along the floor of the pocket.

However sometimes there's a long way from one pass end to the next pass
start, and obstacles can intervene: other islands, and the walls of the
pocket itself.

To select which of "raise, traverse, plunge" and "feed" to use:

    the proposed feed move is a g1 from the current (X, Y) to the start
    of the next pass

    If the proposed feed intersects the original slotting toolpath we'll
    gouge the wall of the pocket, so choose RTP (FIXME: or follow along
    the slotting path until the second intersection?

    If the proposed feed comes within tool_radius of any island other
    than the one we're on, it gouges that island, so choose RTP (FIXME:
    or do that island instead?)

    If the proposed feed intersects the next pass, *except* at the start
    point, then it gouges the island we're on, so choose RTP (FIXME: or
    choose a different starting point in the next pass?)

    If we get here there's no gouge, so choose that feed move
